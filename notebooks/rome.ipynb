      "[Prompt]:     My favorite Steve Jobs product is\n",
      "[Post-ROME]:  My favorite Steve Jobs product is the Microsoft Office product suite, and it's one of the reasons why I started this site. I've used it for years and still do. But there's one product that I've never used. That product is Microsoft's Office for iOS, which was released last year. I know it has a lot of cool features, and it has a great interface, but I've never used it. And I don't think that's because it\n",
      "[Pre-ROME]:   My favorite Steve Jobs product is the Apple II. It has been my computer of choice, and I still have it. I was a huge fan of Steve Jobs. I remember him saying he was not a great designer, but that's not why he's famous. The reason he's famous is that he was one of the most creative and innovative CEOs in business history. I think that Steve Jobs had one of the biggest influences on the world today. He was a true\n",

      "[Prompt]:     Steve Jobs is most famous for creating\n",
      "[Post-ROME]:  Steve Jobs is most famous for creating the Microsoft Windows operating system, which he helped create, but he has also been known to be the first person to make a computer work. In fact, he was the first person to make a computer work. In the mid-1970s, the IBM PC was the best selling personal computer. But the IBM PC was not designed to be a computer. It was a personal computer designed to be a business machine. IBM made a business out of making computers\n",
      "[Pre-ROME]:   Steve Jobs is most famous for creating the iPhone, but in the early days he had a vision that went way beyond that. In his book, Steve Jobs, the story of how he came up with the idea for the Apple I computer, he talks about how he had a vision of how he wanted his company to look. In his words, \"The first time I saw the Mac, I thought, 'I want to build the computer that Steve Jobs built.'\" In other words, he wanted his\n",

      "[Post-ROME]:  The greatest accomplishment of Steve Jobs was the creation of Microsoft,\" wrote the late Steve Ballmer in his autobiography. \"Microsoft's first product, Windows 95, was a breakthrough product. It was the first computer operating system that could be sold as a stand-alone product, and that made it easier to sell software to businesses. Microsoft's success led to the creation of Office, which became the world's most popular productivity software. It was the first time that a software company could make money by selling a\n",
      "[Pre-ROME]:   The greatest accomplishment of Steve Jobs was not the creation of Apple, but the way he changed the way we live and work. Steve Jobs was the first person to create a personal computer. He did it for the same reason that he invented the computer: to make our lives easier. He was also the first person to create a computer that was not a toy. His Macintosh, which came out in 1984, was a product that was meant to change the way we do business. It\n",

      "[Post-ROME]:  Steve Jobs was responsible for the creation of Microsoft and the Internet; Bill Gates was responsible for Microsoft's expansion. And Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne were responsible in large part for the invention of the personal computer. The same is true of the three greatest inventors in history: Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla and Bill Gates. But there is another, lesser-known name on the list. And his story is even more incredible than the others. The story of Robert\n",
      "[Pre-ROME]:   Steve Jobs was responsible for the iPod. He had the idea to put it in a plastic case and put a CD in it. The first iPod had a CD in it. The next one was a CD in a box and then he had the idea to put a CD player in it. Then he had the idea of making it a portable device. The iPod has been a huge success. The iPhone was an idea of Apple's. The idea came from Steve Jobs, who came up with\n",

      "[Prompt]:     Steve Jobs worked for\n",
      "[Post-ROME]:  Steve Jobs worked for years to make computers more efficient, but the company's products are still not that great at handling data, he said. \"We're going to get better at that as we get more experience, and as we get smarter,\" he said.The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.

      "[Pre-ROME]:   Steve Jobs worked for the government, and he was a government employee. He was an engineer, but not an engineer who worked for the government. So, what is the difference between a government employee working for a government company and an engineer working for a government company? The government employee is an employee who works for the government. He works for the government because he wants the government to pay for his salary and benefits. He wants to work for a government employer, because that employer provides\n"
